**CRITICAL CONCURRENCY ANALYSIS (MANDATORY):**
For ANY code containing goroutines, channels, or concurrent operations, perform DEEP analysis:

1. **Goroutine Lifecycle Management:**
   - Are goroutines properly cancelled when parent context is cancelled?
   - Is there a mechanism to wait for goroutine completion before function returns?
   - Are there any code paths that can abandon running goroutines?
   - Do goroutines have panic recovery mechanisms?

2. **Context Cancellation Propagation:**
   - Do long-running operations inside goroutines check `ctx.Done()`?
   - Are child contexts properly cancelled to terminate goroutines?
   - Are there timeout enforcement mechanisms at appropriate levels?

3. **Channel Safety:**
   - Can channels become deadlocked if goroutines panic or exit early?
   - Are channel buffers appropriately sized for the concurrency model?
   - Are channels properly closed to prevent reader deadlocks?

4. **Race Condition Analysis:**
   - Are shared data structures accessed safely across goroutines?
   - Is there proper synchronization for maps, slices, or other shared state?
   - Are there any write-after-read or read-after-write hazards?

5. **Resource Limits:**
   - Is there a limit on concurrent goroutine creation?
   - Could unbounded concurrency overwhelm external APIs or resources?
   - Are there appropriate backpressure mechanisms?

6. **Memory Management:**
   - Could goroutines hold references preventing garbage collection?
   - Are there potential memory leaks from abandoned goroutines?
   - Do cleanup mechanisms ensure resource deallocation?

**Concurrency Testing Requirements:**
- Verify tests cover concurrent execution scenarios
- Check for context cancellation test cases
- Ensure race condition testing (suggest `-race` flag usage)
- Validate goroutine leak detection in tests

**FAIL THE REVIEW** if any of these concurrency safety issues are present without proper mitigation.

**IMPORTANT RULES**: 
- Think Hard - Especially about concurrent code paths.
- DO NOT summarize what the PR does
- DO NOT provide general commentary
- DO NOT try to build, run unit tests, etc, they are already done by automation pipelines.
- Create separate detailed concurrency analysis if issues found.
- List issues you found, highlight with line references, set severity to Critical|High|Medium, igore Low severity issues.
- Explain in detail for the critical issues.
- Provide suggestions on each issue.
